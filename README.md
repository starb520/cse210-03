In this game the player first chooses a difficulty level from 1-3. Then the player proceeeds to 
enter in letters, trying to guess the word that is at the difficulty the player previously chose. Each time the player gets one wrong the parachute loses a piece until the man dies and the player loses, or the player finds the word and wins! Then the player has the option to play again!
